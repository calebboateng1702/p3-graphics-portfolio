## Overview

This project was developed as an academic exploration into building a structured brand identity system that can scale across digital and physical platforms.

The objective was to approach the assignment as a real-world branding challenge rather than a design exercise.

---

## The Challenge

The core problem addressed in this project was:

- How can a brand maintain consistency across multiple touchpoints?
- How do we design a system rather than isolated visuals?
- How can minimal design still communicate authority?

---

## Approach

The strategy focused on:

- Creating a modular logo system
- Defining clear typographic hierarchy
- Establishing strong color contrast
- Designing layout principles that support scalability

The emphasis was on clarity, structure, and long-term usability.

---

## Design System

The identity system includes:

- Primary + secondary logo variations
- Defined color palette with hierarchy roles
- Typography structure (headline vs body logic)
- Spacing and grid logic
- Application mockups for real-world context

---

## Deliverables

- Logo construction system
- Visual hierarchy framework
- Brand mockups
- Social template layout system
- Application examples
